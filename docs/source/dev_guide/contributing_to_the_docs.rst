Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

This documentation is generated using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__. If you would like to contribute
to the documentation, you can do so by editing the reStructuredText files in the ``docs/source`` directory of the OpenRocket repo.
You can then build the documentation by first `installing Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`__
and then running the following command from the ``docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    make html

This will generate the documentation in the ``docs/build/html`` directory. You can then view the documentation by opening the
``index.html`` file in your web browser.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, please submit a pull request with your changes. If you are not sure how to
do this, please see the ``Obtaining the Source Code`` section in :doc:`Development Environment Setup </dev_guide/development_setup>`.

`submit an issue <https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/new/choose>`__ with your proposed changes and we will take care of the rest,
or you can `contact us <https://openrocket.info/contact.html>`__.
